 DH_germany_rk.1.t:0 "Reichskommissariat Ostland"
 DH_germany_rk.1.d:0 "The Baltics and Belarus have come under military jurisdication, prompting the question of what should be done with the region.

 DH_germany_rk.3.a:0 "Establish the Reichskommissariat."
 DH_germany_rk.3.b:0 "Continue Military Occupation."

As long as our military and industry retain access to the rich oil fields in the south."

 DH_germany_rk.8.d:0 "Beyond the Ural Mountains lies the vast expanse of forests, rivers, and plains, filled with the riches of mother nature. A wilderness that stretches for thousands of kilometres, only to be sparsely interrupted by human activity. Ruling such an enormous region is difficult enough, let alone for the army.
